# Exercise Randomizer

Based on an input csv this script will randomize a number of exercises to do.

Please see the [template](template.csv) on how to set up your own exercises. The exercises in the template are from [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra8nyiGwoLc). The weight and reps is set to something sensible for a beginner (otherwise adjust them yourself).
